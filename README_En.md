This repository showcases a complete AI-powered pipeline, turning a handwritten weather log image into a **clean, structured summary automatically emailed and archived**, using:

- ✅ **Mistral OCR** (French high-performance optical character recognition)
- ✅ **Mistral Small (LLM)** for natural language synthesis
- ✅ **n8n** for orchestration and automation
- ✅ **Google Sheets** for archiving

## Objective

Demonstrate that a **real handwritten document**, even in stylized italic fonts, can be:
- accurately read without OCR fine-tuning,
- summarized in fluent, professional French,
- sent and archived automatically via a modern no-code workflow.

> ⚠️ API keys and webhook URLs have been removed for security reasons. Please replace them with your own values in order to reproduce the workflows.

## 🚀 Results

- OCR recognition, even on **stylized italic fonts**, was **outstanding** thanks to Mistral OCR.
- The generated summary was **fluent, accurate, and human-readable**, even for real documents.
- Everything is **fully automated** (upload → OCR → LLM → email + archive) with zero manual intervention.

⏱️ **End-to-end processing time**: a few seconds per image (including summarization).

## 🔁 Reproducibility

This project is **fully reproducible**:
- via n8n using the included workflow blueprint,
- or via the Python notebook to send test images.
